  This Project involves :-


  1. Data Exploration and Cleaning :
          Initially, the dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure and contents. Various visualizations were plotted to identify patterns and distributions. Missing values were detected and handled by either dropping irrelevant columns or imputing appropriate values based on statistical measures.

 2. Model Training and Evaluation:
          The Logistic Regression model was chosen for its suitability in binary classification problems such as predicting the presence of heart disease. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated to give a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness.
    
3. Model Optimization: 
       Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the Logistic Regression model. This step is crucial to enhance the model's predictive performance and ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

   CONCLUSION:
         The project demonstrates a systematic approach to predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. From data acquisition, exploration, and cleaning, to model training, evaluation, and optimization, each step is crucial in building an accurate and reliable predictive model.

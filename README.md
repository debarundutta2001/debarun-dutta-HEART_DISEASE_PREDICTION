   (devtern_internships_tasks)


This project aims to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression to estimate the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health-related features. The project involves data acquisition, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

Tools and Technologies:

Python: The primary programming language used for this project.

Pandas: A popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: A library for efficient numerical computations.

Seaborn: A visualization library built on top of Matplotlib for data visualization.

Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for model development, training, and evaluation.

Pyreadstat: A library for reading and writing statistical files.

Libraries and Concepts:

Logistic Regression: A machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems.

Data Preprocessing: Techniques used to clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: The process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that are suitable for modeling.

Confusion Matrix: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

Accuracy Score: A metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

Precision Score: A metric used to evaluate the precision of a classification model.

Recall Score: A metric used to evaluate the recall of a classification model.

F1 Score: A metric used to evaluate the F1 score of a classification model.

Grid Search: A technique used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models.

Project Steps:

Data Acquisition: The Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are replaced with mean or median values.

Feature Engineering: The dataset is transformed into a suitable format for modeling.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search is used to tune the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model.

Key Findings:

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy score of [0.7222222222222222].

The model performed well in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score.

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search improved the performance of the model.

Conclusion:    This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression in predicting heart disease based on various health-related features. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning in developing an accurate predictive model. The results of this project can be used to inform healthcare professionals and individuals about the likelihood of heart disease based on their health characteristics.
